              <p>
                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
                personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
                information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because
                your personal information has been stored in backup archives),
                then we will securely store your personal information and
                isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
                possible.

                  We aim to protect your personal information through a system
                  of organizational and technical security measures.

              </p>
              <p>
                We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational
                security measures designed to protect the security of any
                personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards
                and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
                transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
                can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
                guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
                third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and
                improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
                Although we will do our best to protect your personal
                information, transmission of personal information to and from
                our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
                Services within a secure environment.

              <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting
                you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
                recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
                other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
                to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

                information you provide with the information we already have on
